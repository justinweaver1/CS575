appointment, check their billing status, fulfill new perscriptions and seek help with the portal.  

This project uses many modern design features. It is implemented using the Java EE 7 web framework. It uses many modern concepts
including Java Server Faces, Java Persistance API, EBJs and Java Web Services. 

Running the Software:

The project is implemented as Maven Web Application project. To run this project, you can simply down this repository, unzip, import to your 
favorite Java EE enabled IDE, import the project to the IDE, build and deploy to your Java EE web container. 

If you do not wish to use an IDE, you may also download Maven and a Java EE compliant web container and build and deploy manually.
